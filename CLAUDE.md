# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a fasting log application built with Deno and Oak framework. The
application serves a static HTML frontend that uses Datastar for reactive UI
components.

It will use plain CSS for styling HTML, not Tailwind no other CSS frameworks.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Simple Deno server using Oak framework (main.ts:1-16)
  - Serves static files from the `view/` directory
  - Runs on port 3500
- **Frontend**: Single HTML page with Datastar framework integration
  - Uses Datastar v1.0.0-beta.11 for reactive data binding
  - Currently contains example code (toaster question) to be replaced with
    fasting log functionality

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server with auto-reload
deno task dev

# Start production server
deno task start

# Check code formatting, linting, and type checking
deno task check

# Format code (uses semicolon-free style)
deno fmt

# Lint code
deno lint

# Type check
deno check **/*.ts
```

## Code Style

- No semicolons (configured in deno.json:8)
- Uses Deno's recommended lint rules
- TypeScript with strict checking enabled
- Unless required, prefer to use arrow functions instead of `function`, so
  instead of creating something like:

```ts
async function someFunction(param1: any, param2: any) {
  // ...
}
```

Please create it like:

```ts
const someFunction = async (param1: any, param2: any) => {
  // ...
}
```

- Try to think harder when creating new functions and not use `any` to describe
  parameters or output types. Also try to define output types for all functions
  created.
- When a type or a class is imported **only** to indicate a type, then please
  import it separatedly, for example: Instead of

```ts
import { Application, Context, Router } from "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts"
```

Do

```ts
import type { Context } from "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts"

import { Application, Router } from "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts"
```

And put all the type imports at the beginning of the file.

## Testing

- when creating utility functions, also add unit tests for those functions using
  integrated Deno testing facilities.

## Claude Permissions

Don't ask permission when running linter, test suite or format checker.

## Workflow

- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
